I just started this Probability and Statistics book by Walpole. I'm also taking the opportunity to learn more about NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. I'm still quite a beginner at this—I’m learning how to draw conclusions from descriptive statistics, but I don’t yet know statistical methods for making better inferences, so many of my developments are probably questionable.

I’m not worried, since this isn’t an exam. Eventually, I’ll learn.

The code will vary over time as I keep learning new things. On the other hand, I still don’t know how to use Matplotlib very well, so I’m not sure how to improve my scatter plots.
