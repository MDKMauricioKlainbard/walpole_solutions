I just started this Probability and Statistics book by Walpole. I'm also taking the opportunity to learn more about NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib. I'm still quite a beginner at this—I’m learning how to draw conclusions from descriptive statistics, but I don’t yet know statistical methods for making better inferences, so many of my developments are probably questionable.

I’m not worried, since this isn’t an exam. Eventually, I’ll learn.

The code will vary over time as I keep learning new things. On the other hand, I still don’t know how to use Matplotlib very well, so I’m not sure how to improve my scatter plots.

Finishing the last exercise section of Chapter 1. Although several exercises turned out to be repetitive, they helped me discover new Python tools for making my plots and more. Some exercises proved to be enriching for my knowledge, while also revealing my (temporary) ignorance as I had to struggle to reach certain conclusions.

Of course, I’m still somewhat inexperienced at identifying populations and understanding the nature of samples. I hope that, with time, I’ll be able to improve that skill.

Nevertheless, I’m satisfied with some of the skills I’ve developed so far.
