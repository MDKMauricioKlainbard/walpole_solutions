GitHub Copilot is amazing. Of course, I’m not writing down anything that GitHub Copilot suggests if I don’t understand it. If there’s something I don’t understand, I look it up before using it. What really benefits me is being able to write down what I’m thinking faster, since it predicts my intentions from just a couple of words in the comments.

Today, I also learned how to better use some NumPy operations, like set operations and boolean indexing.

Likewise, I learned to use another library to create Venn diagrams and how to manipulate the regions of the diagram through binary identifiers. This has been extremely useful for me.

As I said, I don’t autocomplete anything from GitHub Copilot that I don’t understand. Some autocomplete suggestions that Copilot gave me, I didn’t initially know how they worked, but I had an idea of what they did. With a few internet searches, I was able to learn all these new tools.

For now, the theory about sample spaces is simple and familiar to me since I’m more than used to set theory. The bigger challenge is the ability to associate a sample space with a statistical population. I mean being able to answer the question: “From which population, given the experiment I’m conducting, am I obtaining these sample points?”

For example, the sample space defined by S={H,T}, where the sample points define the outcome of flipping a coin. I can understand my procedure as:

1. Identify the population as all coin flips that take place during a game;

2. Understand that my experiment is analyzing the results I obtain from each flip;

3. Understand that each observation is the result of a single flip;

4. Define the sample space by the possible outcomes I can get in a flip (H or T).

Perhaps defining the population itself is also difficult. I can’t simply say, “It’s all hypothetical coin flips,” because then I’d be including the time an Egyptian flipped a coin before Christ. No.

So, I assume I should limit myself to a period of time that my experiment is intended to cover. Perhaps within the same game; perhaps across all future games from this moment on; maybe even extrapolating an analysis to past games.

I hope to clarify these doubts soon.
